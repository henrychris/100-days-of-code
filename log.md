# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2023 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: I covered type basics, common errors and TS benefits. I also tried to write a function for splitting payments, which is currently more complex than envisioned.

**Thoughts**: I am not very good at functional programming, that is chaining the calls. I need to know how to execute one function, then the next and so on.
