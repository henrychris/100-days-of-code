# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2023 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: I covered type basics, common errors and TS benefits. I also tried to write a function for splitting payments, which is currently more complex than envisioned.

**Thoughts**: I am not very good at functional programming, that is chaining the calls. I need to know how to execute one function, then the next and so on.

### Day 2: August 01, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Looked at interfaces and type assertions. Also solved two practice problems from the learning TypeScript textbook.

**Thoughts**: Some of this stuff was rather confusing. I need to take another look at index signatures, and practice them. Array syntax and manipulation needs works too.

### Day 3: August 03, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about union types, narrowing, null checks, literal types and type aliases.

**Thoughts**: I don't think i learned much practically today. I need to build something to test my knowledge.

### Day 3: August 04, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bunch about classes and type unions in objects. As with most JS, shit is weird and confusing. Built a simple application for library mgt. Need to debug why it doesn't work.

**Thoughts**: I need to spend more time on fundamentals of this language before moving to bigger projects.
