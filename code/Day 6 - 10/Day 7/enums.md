# Enums or Literals?

Whether to prefer literals or enums in TypeScript depends on the specific use case and your goals for code readability, maintainability, and type safety. Both literals and enums have their advantages and use cases, so let's explore when to use each:

## Literals:

Literals are literal values (string literals, numeric literals, etc.) that you can use directly in your code. TypeScript's literal types allow you to create types that represent specific, exact values. Literal types are often used for:

1. Specific Values: When you have a limited set of values that you want to explicitly use.

2. Union Types: When creating union types that consist of specific values.

3. Discriminated Unions: When creating discriminated union types (using a common property to differentiate between different types).

4. Type Safety: When you want to restrict a variable to only accept a certain exact value.

5. Pattern Matching: In advanced cases like discriminated unions, where the exact value determines behavior.

## Enums:

Enums are a feature provided by TypeScript to create a set of named constants, which can be numeric or string values. Enums are often used for:

1. Related Constants: When you have a group of related constants that have some logical connection.

2. Clear Naming: When you want to provide clear, descriptive names for values.

3. Avoid Magic Values: To avoid "magic values" in your code and provide meaningful context.

4. Reverse Mapping: To convert between enum values and their names.

5. Combining Values: Combining values to represent different states.

## Guidelines:

Here are some guidelines to consider when choosing between literals and enums:

### Use Literals:

1. When you have a small, fixed set of specific values.
2. When you want to provide explicit type safety for variables.

### Use Enums:

1. When you have a larger set of related constants that should have logical connections.
2. When you want to avoid "magic values" and provide clear naming.
3. When you need reverse mapping between values and names.
4. When you're working with patterns like discriminated unions.

### Consider Both:

You can sometimes use a combination of literals and enums. For example, using a literal value in a discriminated union's property and using an enum for a larger set of constants.
